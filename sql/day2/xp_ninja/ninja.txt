Fetch the last 2 customers in alphabetical order (A-Z) – exclude ‘id’ from the results.

select concat(first_name,' ',last_name) from customers as full_name order by full_name desc limit 2;

Use SQL to delete all purchases made by Scott.

delete from purchases where customer_id = 3;

Does Scott still exist in the customers table, even though he has been deleted? Try and find him.

select * from customers
Use SQL to find all purchases. Join purchases with the customers table, so that Scott’s order will appear, although instead of the customer’s first and last name, you should only see empty/blank. (Which kind of join should you use?).
Use SQL to find all purchases. Join purchases with the customers table, so that Scott’s order will NOT appear. (Which kind of join should you use?)
