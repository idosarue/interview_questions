Exercise 1: DVD Rental

Instructions

You were hired to babysit your cousin and you want to find a few movies that he can watch with you.

Find out how many films there are for each rating.



Get a list of all the movies that have a rating of G or PG-13.

Filter this list further: look for only movies that are under 2 hours long, and whose rental price (rental_rate) is under 3.00. Sort the list alphabetically.



Find a customer in the customer table, and change his/her details to your details, using SQL UPDATE.

Now find the customer’s address, and use UPDATE to change the address to your address (or make one up).



*****************

1.

1.1 select count(distinct rating) from film;

1.2select title from film where rental_rate < 3 and length < 120 and rating in ('G', 'PG-13') order by title;

1.3 update customer set first_name = 'Ido', last_name = 'Sarue' where customer_id = 1;

1.4 update address set address = 'dizengof 12', city_id = (select city_id from city where city ilike 'tel%'), phone = 0525791695 where address_id = 5;



Exercise 2: Students Table

Update

1. ‘Lea Benichou’ and ‘Marc Benichou’ are twins, they should have the same birth_dates.  Update both their birth_dates to 02/11/1998.



update students set birth_date = '1998/11/02' where last_name = 'Benichou';



2. Change the last_name of David from ‘Grez’ to ‘Guez’.

 insert into students (last_name, first_name, birth_date) values('Guez', 'David','1998/11/02' );



**Delete**

Delete the student named ‘Lea Benichou’ from the table.



 delete from students where first_name = 'lea' and last_name ilike '%benichou%' returning *;



**Count**

Count how many students are in the table.

select count(*) from students;



Count how many students were born after 1/01/2000.

select count(*) from students where birth_date > '2000/01/1';



**Insert / Alter**

Add a column to the student table called math_grade.

 alter table students add math_grade smallint;

Add 80 to the student which id is 1.

 update students set math_grade = 80 where id = 1;

Add 90 to the students which have ids of 2 or 4.

update students set math_grade = 90 where id in(2,4) returning *;


Add 40 to the student which id is 6.

update students set math_grade = 40 where id = 6;

Count how many students have a grade bigger than 83

# select count(*) from students where math_grade > 83;

Add another student named ‘Omer Simpson’ with the same birth_date as the one already in the table. Give him a grade of 70.

insert into students(last_name,first_name, birth_date,math_grade) values ('Simpson', 'Omer', (select birth_date from students where first_name = 'Omer'), 70);

Now, in the table, ‘Omer Simpson’ should appear twice. It’s the same student, although he received 2 different grades because he retook the math exam.

Bonus: Count how many grades each student has.

Tip: You should display the first_name, last_name and the number of grades of each student. If you followed the instructions above correctly, all the students should have 1 math grade, except Omer Simpson which has 2.

select count(math_grade), concat(first_name,' ',last_name) as full_name from students group by full_name;

Tip : Use an alias called total_grade to fetch the grades.

Hint : Use GROUP BY.

SUM

Find the sum of all the students grades.

select sum(math_grade) from students;
