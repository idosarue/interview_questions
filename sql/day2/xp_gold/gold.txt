Exercise 1: DVD Rental
Instructions
You were hired to babysit your cousin and you want to find a few movies that he can watch with you.
Find out how many films there are for each rating.

Get a list of all the movies that have a rating of G or PG-13.
Filter this list further: look for only movies that are under 2 hours long, and whose rental price (rental_rate) is under 3.00. Sort the list alphabetically.

Find a customer in the customer table, and change his/her details to your details, using SQL UPDATE.
Now find the customerâ€™s address, and use UPDATE to change the address to your address (or make one up).
